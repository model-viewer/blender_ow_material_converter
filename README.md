This extension relies both on:  
https://github.com/model-viewer/io_scene_owm  
https://github.com/model-viewer/io_anim_seanim  

The reason of this extension is because both loaders above do not procude GLTF exportable material. This extension simply converts the materials to exportable ones.

This extension is provided as is and might generate wrong results
